inheritance mode. The user can use different inheritance modes to run the script, control results by providing various thresholds in the configuration file. 
For now, the variant inforamtion is given through a mergedVCF file but in future this information could be given through the impala database system
Current Annotation include: Kavair, CMS, UCSC_known_genes, CADD, Clinvar and SNPEff(depending upon availability on Impala)
